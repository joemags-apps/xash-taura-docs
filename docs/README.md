# Introduction to OTT Voucher API Documentation

Welcome to the OTT Voucher API Documentation provided by Xash. This comprehensive guide is designed to help developers integrate our OTT voucher system into their applications seamlessly. The OTT Voucher API allows for the redemption and verification of vouchers in a secure and efficient manner, ensuring that your application can handle voucher transactions with ease.

## Getting Started

To get started with the OTT Voucher API, you will need to:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up to obtain access to the API and receive your unique JWT token for authentication.

2. **[Authenticate](auth.md)**: Use your JWT token to authenticate API requests. This token ensures that your transactions are secure and that only authorized users can redeem and verify vouchers.

3. **Make Requests**: Send requests to our API endpoints to redeem or verify vouchers using the provided CURL commands or by implementing the API calls in your application code.


## Overview

The OTT Voucher API consists of two primary endpoints:

1. **[Verify Endpoint](verification.md)**: This endpoint is used to verify the status of OTT vouchers. It checks if a voucher is valid, has not been redeemed, or has already been used, providing real-time feedback on the voucher status.

2. **[Redeem Endpoint](redemption.md)**: This endpoint is used to redeem OTT vouchers. When a voucher is redeemed, the equivalent value is credited to the user's account, and the voucher is marked as used.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is structured to provide you with all the information needed to work with the OTT Voucher API:

- **[Authentication](auth.md)**: Learn how to authenticate your API requests using JWT tokens.
- **[Verifying Vouchers](verification.md)**: Discover how to verify the status of vouchers before or after redemption.
- **[Redeeming Vouchers](redemption.md)**: Understand how to redeem vouchers and handle different response scenarios.
